3 different models used for predictions:
	1) Amino Acid composition (amino_acid_composition_model) - The amino acid composition is calculated for each sequence and a vector of 20 features is created. Randomforest (giving the best predictions) is used in this case.
	2) Dipeptide composition (dipeptide_composition_model) - The dipeptide composition is calculated for each sequence and a vector of 400(20X20) is created. SVM (giving the best accuracy) with rbf kernel is used in this case.
	3) Binary profile (binary_profile_model) - Binary profile is calculated using a window size of 10 from both the sides(c&n) of a sequence. If size of sequence is lesser than 10, 0 is assigned in the remaining vectors. SVM is used again in this case.


GridSearch is used in all models to get the best parameters.

Run all the models infividually to get individual predictions.



Final Result(combine_predictions.csv) is generated by combining all the individual predictions. This is done by choosing the value with maximum occurance(greater than or equal to 2) from the 3 individual predictions. Run combine_models.py for this.
